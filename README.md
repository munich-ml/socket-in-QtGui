# Goal
I have an existing Python Qt application and wanted to control it from a Python script. 

# Solution
This socket-in-QtGui project solved that problem by implementing a bidirectional TCP/IP socket connection between the Qt-Gui based server and a script based client.

# Project content
## Server
- `server.py` is the socket server application. Run it to launch the Qt-Gui
- `server_ui.py` don't touch! Autogenerated ui code from pyuic (Python UI compiler) and it's input, the `server_ui.ui`
- `toPy.bat` helper batch script (for Windows). pyuic location may differ depending on the installation. 

## Client
- `client.py` is the contains the actual socket client class. It can be executed as main and used interactively in an IPython console
- `using_the_client.ipynb` imports the socket client class and showcases example usage
